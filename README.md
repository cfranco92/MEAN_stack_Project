# MEAN_stack_Project
Project developed using full stack JavaScript.
MEAN = MongoDB, Express, Angular y Node.js

## 1. Technical specifications
Remember that a stack is a set of technologies, possible combinations to complete a project. 
MEAN is a one of the most important stack and with the largest community in the software industry today.

## 2. What is MEAN?
A development stack is like your toolbox. It is the set of technologies that we use to develop a project, be it a web application, an application for mobile devices or what you want create.

To build a web application, for example, we can use Backbone or React for out frontend and Node, PHP or Rails for the backend. We can run our code inside a virtual machine like Vagrant or develop directly in our computer there are many options and you can combine them as you want, of course, some combinations represent better performance in your applications, there are well known and well tested combinations that have good behavior as MEAN.

MEAN is one of the most used technology stacks to create Single Page Applications:
* MongoDB for the database
* Express as a frameworkbackend running on Node.js
* And Angular for the frontend

These technologies are very simple to combine: everything is written in JavaScript, even the database saves collections with objects in JSON.

Node.js is our web server, in charge of listening to users requests and responding with the data they require.
* Configure your routes
* Protect resources
* Serve static files

Express is the micro-framework that will make our lives much easier, allowing us to save time and line of code. At the same time it gives us the freedom to organize the files and use the modules we need for our project.

At this point it is important that we talk about data persistence. MongoDB is one of the NoSQL databases most used today. It allows us to store objects in JSON format without a rigid data schema, as in relational data.
From Express we will ask for data to the database, who will respond to our queries.

But all this does not make sense it the users can not acces our application visually: Angular is the tool of our box that completes de stack. It is one of the most popular frameworks, tih one of the largest and most active communities in frontend development.

With Angular we can create visual and reusable components throughout our project or even in other projects. Develop injectable services in these components to communicate with the backend making requests for data and receiving the answers.
